Fluid Twitter
===============

A Userscript for Fluid that streamlines the twitter interface to
make it usable in a flexible (but mostly thin) Fluid instance

Features
--------

New tweets are loaded every 30 seconds by refreshing the page.

On top of recent tweets a link is added that marks all messages as read by
fading them. When new tweets arrve the count is reflected on the badge of the dock icon.

The mark all read link can be accessed with ctrl+a.

Dock menu item: settings shortcut.


Installation
===============
(Assuming you've already downloaded Fluid from Fluidapp.com)

1. Create a new Fluid SSB
-- URL: http://twitter.com/home (you could also use http://twitter.com/username, but home will redirect you to the login as necessary)
2. Run the Fluid SSB you just created
3. In the menu, navigate to Userscripts -> Open Userscripts Folder
4. Paste fluid_twitter.user.js into the SSB's Userscript folder
5. In the menu of your SSB navigate to Userscripts -> Reload All Userscripts
6. Navigate to Userscripts -> Fluid Twitter to toggle it's enablement (is that a word?)
7. Use Cmd-R to reload SSB window

You Win!

Caveats
===============
* As of FluidInstance 0.8.2, SSB's will not persist the enablement of your Userscripts. Translation: you will have to enable Fluid Twitter every time you open your SSB

TODO
===============
* Have Fluid Twitter to a JSON request to see if your friends timeline has been updated before reloading the window. This will require a way to persist username (and possibly password).
* Append last read tweet id to Recent/Replies/Archive/Everyone links so that
read tweets will persist when navigating
